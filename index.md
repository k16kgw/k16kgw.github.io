# Research Interests

I'm studying the well-posedness of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations. Currently, I am studying the well-posedness of initial value and time-periodic problems of the Cahn–Hilliard equation, which was derived to describe spinodal decomposition, a phase separation phenomenon in alloys, under Dirichlet or dynamic boundary conditions. Understanding well-posedness of problems is a minimum requirement to determine whether an equation derived by modeling a natural phenomenon is mathematically appropriate as a model or not. It also serves as a basis for theoretical assurance of the validity of numerical simulation results.
